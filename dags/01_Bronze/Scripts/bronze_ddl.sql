=============================================================
Bronze Layer Table Creation
=============================================================
Script Purpose:
    This script creates the initial table structures in the 'bronze' schema of the 'fantasyPL' 
    database. The bronze layer serves as the landing zone for raw, unprocessed data ingested 
    from the Fantasy Premier League API. Four tables are created:
    - teams_info: Stores basic team information
    - players_info: Stores individual player details
    - games_info: Stores match/fixture information
    - player_stats: Stores player performance statistics

Assumptions:
    - The 'fantasyPL' database already exists
    - The 'bronze' schema already exists in the database
    - Data types are based on expected API response structures

WARNING:
    - If these tables already exist in the 'bronze' schema, running this script without 
      modification will result in an error. To recreate the tables, you would need to 
      explicitly DROP them first (not included here to prevent accidental data loss).
    - Ensure appropriate disk space is available for the database and schema.
    - No constraints (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys) are defined in this initial 
      bronze layer to maintain raw data integrity as received from the source.
