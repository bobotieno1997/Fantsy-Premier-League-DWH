/*
    Test Script: Data Quality Check for silver.player_stats - Null Values
    Purpose: Detects rows with null values in critical fields to verify data completeness.
    Table: silver.player_stats
    Note: Duplicates are expected in this table and are not evaluated here.
    Expected Result: Empty result set indicates no nulls; non-empty set flags incomplete data.
    Action: Investigate source data or ETL process if nulls are found in key fields.
